Uploading Files Kitchen Sink
============================

An example of uploading files with all the bells and whistles. The UI displays progress for computing checksums,
as well as upload progresson the part level. This code is meant to demonstrate how to use the various parts of
the upload API, but does not demonstrate a neatly organized upload component. Please reference the API calls, but
we do not suggest using this as the basis for your upload widget.
